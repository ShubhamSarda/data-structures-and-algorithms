- Initial number with filenames doesn't donotes anything, they are used just to maintain the sequence.


## Course Curriculum

Throughout the course, we will explore the most important Data Structures and Algorithms topics step-by-step:

**1. Essential Concepts**
- Big O Notation
- Memory
- Logarithms
- Recursion

**2. Data structures:**
- Arrays
- Linked Lists (Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Circular Linked List)
- Stacks- Queues- Hash Tables
- Trees (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees)
- Heaps (Binary Heaps)
- Tries
- Graphs

**3. Algorithms:**
- Elementary Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort)
- Advance Searching Algorithms (Quick Sort, Merge Sort)
- Tree Traversal (Breadth First Search: Level Order Traversal and Depth First Search: PreOrder, InOrder, PostOrder)
- Graph Traversal (Breadth-First Search, Depth First Search)

**4. Interview Questions**
- Two Sum
- MinMax Stack
- Design Linked List
